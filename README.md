# ESP32 Blynk Example
This example code demonstrates how to use the Blynk library on an ESP32 microcontroller to connect to the Blynk cloud service.

## Hardware Requirements
> ESP32 development board
> USB cable for programming and power
## Software Requirements
> Arduino IDE or other compatible development environment
> Blynk library for ESP32
## Setup
1. Install the Blynk library for ESP32 in your development environment.
2. Open the ledBlink.ino file in your development environment and update the following variables with your own values:
```
- BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID
- BLYNK_DEVICE_NAME
- BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN
```
3.  Change ssid and pass with your wifi network name and password.
4.  Connect your ESP32 development board to your computer using the USB cable.
5.  Select the correct board and port in your development environment.
6.  Upload the code to your ESP32 board.
7.  Open the Serial Monitor to see the ESP32 connecting to your wifi network and Blynk cloud service.
8.  Open the Blynk app on your smartphone and add a new device using the template ID, device name, and auth token provided in the code.
9.  Once connected, you can use the Blynk app to toggle the state of the virtual pins V0, V1, V2 and V3 and see the state of these pins in the serial monitor.
## Notes
```
Make sure to use the correct board and port in your development environment.
The Blynk library uses a lot of memory, so it may not be possible to use other libraries or add additional functionality to the code.
Troubleshooting
If the ESP32 is not connecting to your wifi network, check that the ssid and pass variables have the correct values.
If the ESP32 is not connecting to the Blynk cloud service, check that the BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID, BLYNK_DEVICE_NAME, and BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN variables have the correct values.
